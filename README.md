# Face-Mask-Detection

A deep learning CNN application inspired by the MobileNet architecture.

First of all a big thanks to <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrika-deb/"> Chandrika Deb </a> for providing the dataset.

The model uses the MobileNet architecture followed by some custom FC layers added on top. The model is then trained and the accuracy of the trained model is around 85 percent.
The model performs quite well.
